Use this rule to report duplicated anchors and aliases referencing undeclared
anchors.

.. rubric:: Options

* Set ``forbid-undeclared-aliases`` to ``true`` to avoid aliases that reference
  an anchor that hasn't been declared (either not declared at all, or declared
  later in the document).
* Set ``forbid-duplicated-anchors`` to ``true`` to avoid duplications of a same
  anchor.

.. rubric:: Default values (when enabled)

.. code-block:: yaml

 rules:
   anchors:
     forbid-undeclared-aliases: true
     forbid-duplicated-anchors: false

.. rubric:: Examples

#. With ``anchors: {forbid-undeclared-aliases: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    ---
    - &anchor
      foo: bar
    - *anchor

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    ---
    - &anchor
      foo: bar
    - *unknown

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::

    ---
    - &anchor
      foo: bar
    - <<: *unknown
      extra: value

#. With ``anchors: {forbid-duplicated-anchors: true}``

   the following code snippet would **PASS**:
   ::

    ---
    - &anchor1 Foo Bar
    - &anchor2 [item 1, item 2]

   the following code snippet would **FAIL**:
   ::
